<h3>Visual Entropy as a tool for Better Visualization</h3>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
        <p>The information theoretic view of visualization and human visual cognition provides some insights into the
            information flow from data to perception. However, Shannon entropy is not designed for representing the type
            of
            noisy receiver that is the human brain, for example Shannon receivers do not make up hypotheses about
            missing
            information or infer new ideas they simply reproduce a message from a sender. On the other hand
            visualization as
            design can lack rigour and rely on design experience rather than theoretical underpinnings. Bertin's
            semiology of
            graphics takes this approach, developing a practically useful but informal approach to information
            representation.
            Over the last few years we have been exploring an approach to visualization design for glyphs that is
            founded in
            information theory and allows us to predict experimental outcomes for glyph designs. This is based on the
            observation that while humans are noisy information receivers they are still sensitive to the information
            content in
            a signal.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Nick Holliman researches the science and engineering of visualization and visual analytics, addressing the
    fundamental challenges of visualization for Data Science and AI. His research includes the psychophysics of the
    human visual system, the creation of novel algorithms for the control of image content to match human abilities and
    demonstrating how these algorithms work in practice in scalable cloud-based software tools and award-winning 3D
    visualizations. He has worked in both industrial and academic environments and is experienced in delivering
    commercial impact from research outputs. He has led the design of high-performance visualization theatres at four
    different institutions which have been specified to support both individual and team-based decision making. He
    currently leads the Scalable research group at Newcastle University, is visualization lead for the Newcastle
    University Centre of Research Excellence in Data and is a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute where he co-convenes
    the Visualization Interest Group #VizTIG, he is a member of IEEE CS, ACM, IS&T and a fellow of the RSS.</p>
