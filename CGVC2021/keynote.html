<h3>Keynote 1: Proton Imaging – a new tool for cancer treatment</h3>
<div class="row">

    <div class="col-8">
        <p>Proton, and other charged-particles, radiotherapy is rapidly growing in application for difficult tumours and
            most
            cancers in children. Protons do not behave like photons and so our “cameras” must identify the incident and
            exiting
            trackers of millions of individual protons as they pass through a patient as well as recording the residual
            enemy of
            each individual.  While outlining the clinical advantages of imaging and treating with the same radiation
            type and
            the engineering of the instrument, we will focus on the imaging challenges – CT reconstruction, treatment
            planning,
            target identification and dose mapping. The future role of machine learning and producing optimum
            personalised and
            adaptive treatments will be discussed.</p>

        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <p>Prof Nigel M Allinson holds the Distinguished Chair of Image Engineering at the University of Lincoln.  He
            has
            produced over 350 papers and patents, and co-founded five spin-off companies.  Nigel was awarded the MBE for
            Services to Engineering and the IET J J Thompson Medal for advancing imaging technologies.

        <h3>Keynote 2: eXtended Reality (XR) and Healthcare Applications - A Personal Review and Forward-Look</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>eXtended Reality (XR) has recently become the preferred term used to refer to all real-and-virtual combined
                    environments
                    and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables, where the 'X' represents a
                    variable for
                    any current or future spatial computing technologies. However, long before this term was introduced I had
                    been
                    collaborating with many excellent colleagues from across the UK and Europe to achieve what we would now call
                    XR
                    applications in healthcare settings. In the talk I will use examples from these projects to demonstrate the
                    evolution of
                    technologies and the associated cost-performance, and discuss how the healthcare sector is now on the verge
                    of achieving
                    significant benefits for both patients and clinical professionals.

<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Professor Nigel John is a Fellow of the Eurographics Association and a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales. He
    obtained his PhD in Mathematical Sciences from the University of Bath in 1990. Following a career in industry
    working
    for ICI/Zeneca and Silicon Graphics Inc., he returned to academia and has held senior posts at the University of
    Manchester and Bangor University before joining the University of Chester. Whilst at Bangor he was instrumental
    in
    setting up the pan-Wales Research Institute of Visual Computing. At Chester, he leads the Medical Graphics
    research
    group. Throughout his career he has been proactive in applying computer graphics and related technology to
    medical
    applications. In 2006 he received the international Satava Award for his accomplishments to the field of
    computer
    graphics and medical visualization.
