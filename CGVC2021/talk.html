<h3>Challenges in Graphics Development for Mobile Devices</h3>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
        <p>My focus in this talk is on the development of mobile phones as gaming platforms, the increased power that is
            available with them, and the challenges involved in harnessing that potential. By delving into the
            performance gaps between different generations of hardware, and the unique challenges presented by the
            mobile ecosystem, this talk will explore some of the issues to be faced, and possible solutions for
            overcoming them.</p>

<h3>"Soft Skills" Considered Harmful: Growth, Change and Adaptation in the Graphics Industry </h3>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
        <p>The term "soft skill" is frequently used to describe any non-technical ability that is nevertheless
            considered valuable in an organisation. These skills range from mindfulness, to social and emotional
            intelligence, to the capacity to think and act holistically. Despite playing a quintessential role in our
            day-to-day lives, soft skills are often significantly undervalued compared to the technical proficiencies
            that are universally recognised as mission-critical. In this talk, I argue that hard and soft skills are
            merely two sides of the same coin, and that treating them as a dichotomy impairs an organisation's
            resilience and its ability to react to change. To illustrate this point, I share some of my personal
            experiences working in the film and games industries, and describe how my most rewarding and empowering
            moments came through the synthesis of technical expertise and an empathetic, people-focused mindset. I also
            advocate for the value of systems thinking in the tech and entertainment sectors, whose rapid growth and
            immense reach have combined to make them powerful changemakers with a profound social responsibility. I
            conclude with a discussion of my recent time at Unity, and how I continue to draw upon these patterns to
            help the organisation grow while maintaining its founding principles of independence, empowerment, and a
            deep commitment to its users.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Ben Spencer is a senior software engineer with an academic and industry background in physically based rendering. He
    began his career at Swansea University where he studied for a PhD in computer science, and later as a post-doctorate
    researcher in photorealistic rendering and visualisation. In 2013, he moved to California to join the team at Disney
    Animation where he helped develop the studio's in-house renderer in time for its debut production, Big Hero 6.
    Later, he joined Double Negative (now DNEG) where he worked on upgrading the company's rendering pipeline to deliver
    complex visual effects shots for films including Star Trek Beyond, Annihilation, Pacific Rim 2, and the Marvel
    Cinematic Universe. He now works at Unity Technologies where he continues to apply his expertise in rendering to the
    next generation of games and real-time applications.
