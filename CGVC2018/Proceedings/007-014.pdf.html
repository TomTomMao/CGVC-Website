      Detecting and tracking people in a meeting room is very important for
      many applications. In order to detect people in a meeting room with no
      prior knowledge (e.g. background model) and regardless of whether their
      motion is slow or significant, this paper proposes a coarse-to-fine
      people detection algorithm by combining a novel motion detection process,
      namely, adaptive accumulated frame differencing (AAFD) combined with
      corner features. Firstly, the region of movement is extracted adaptively
      using AAFD, then motion corner features are extracted. Finally, the
      minimum area rectangle fitting these corners is found. The proposed
      algorithm is evaluated using the AMI meeting data set and this indicates
      promising results for people detection.<br>
