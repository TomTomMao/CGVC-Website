      Developing a positive relationship between a business and its customers
      is vital to success. The outcome of any customer interaction can
      determine future patronage of the business. Many industry's only point of
      interaction with their customers is through a contact centre where
      everything from sales to complaints are handled. This places tremendous
      importance on the operational efficiency of the contact centre and the
      level of care provided to the customers. These customer interactions are
      recorded and archived in large databases, but undertaking insightful
      analysis is challenging due to both the size and complexity of the data.
      We present a visual solution to the tracking of customer interactions at
      a large scale. RiverState visualises the collective flow of callers
      through the process of interacting with a contact centre using a river
      metaphor. We use finite state transition machines with customised edges
      to depict millions of events and the states callers go through to
      complete their journey. We implement a range of novel features to enhance
      the analytical qualities of the application, and collect feedback from
      domain experts to analyse and evaluate the use of the software.<br>
