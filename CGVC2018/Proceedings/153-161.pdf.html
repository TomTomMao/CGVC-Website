      3D models of transportation objects like a road, bridge, underpass, etc.
      are required in many domains including military training, land
      development, etc. While remote sensed images and LiDaR data can be used
      to create approximate 3D representations, detailed 3D representations are
      difficult to create automatically. Instead, interactive tools are used
      with rather laborious effort. For example, the top commercial interactive
      model generator we tried required 94 parameters in all for different
      bridge types. In this paper, we take a different path.We automatically
      derive these parameter values from GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
      data, which normally contains detailed information of these objects, but
      often only implicitly. The framework presented here transforms GIS data
      into a knowledge base consisting of assertions. Spatial/numeric relations
      are handled through plug-ins called property extractors whose results get
      added to the knowledge base, used by a reasoning engine to infer object
      properties. A number of properties have to be extracted from images, and
      are dependent on the accuracy of computer vision methods. While a
      comprehensive property extractor mechanism is work in progress, . a
      prototype implementation illustrates our framework for bridges with GIS
      data from the real world. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is
      the first to integrate knowledge inference and uncertainty for extracting
      landscape object properties by fusing facts from multi-modal GIS data
      sources.<br>
