      Groupwise image alignment automatically provides non-rigid registration
      across a set of images. It has found applications in facial image
      analysis and medical image analysis by automatically generating
      statistical models of shape and appearance. The main approaches used
      previously include iterative and graph-based approaches. In iterative
      approaches, the registration of each image is iteratively updated to
      minimise an error measure across the set. Various metrics and
      optimisation strategies have been proposed to achieve this. Graph-based
      methods perform registration of each pair of images in the set, to form a
      weighted graph of the ''distance'' between all the images, and then finds
      the optimal paths between the most central image and every other image.
      In this paper, we use a graph-based approach to perform initialisation,
      which is then refined with an iterative approach. Pairwise registration
      is performed using demons registration, then shortest paths identified in
      the resulting graph are used to provide an initial warp for each image by
      concatenating warps along the path. The warps are refined using an
      iterative Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation to the mean, based on updating
      the locations of a small number of points and incorporating a stiffness
      constraint. This optimisation approach is efficient, has very few free
      parameters to tune and we show how to tune the few remaining parameters.
      We compare the combined approach to both the iterative and graph-based
      approaches used independently. Results demonstrate that the combined
      method improves the alignment of various datasets, including two face
      datasets and a difficult medical dataset of prostate MRI images.<br>
