      The use of colour mapping is fundamental to visualisation research. It
      acts as an additional layer beyond rendering in the spatial dimensions
      and provides a link between values in any dataset. When designing and
      building visualisation research software, the process of creating and
      managing a colour mapping system can be time-consuming and complex.
      Existing alternatives offer niche features and require complex
      dependencies or installations. We present Spectrum; an open source colour
      map management library that is developer friendly with no installation
      required, and that offers a wide variety of features for the majority of
      use cases. We demonstrate the utility of the library through simple
      snippets of code and a number of examples which illustrate its ease of
      use and functionality, as well as a video demonstrating the installation
      and use of the library in under two minutes. It is a very valuable
      jump-start tool for developers and researchers who need to focus on other
      tasks.<br>
