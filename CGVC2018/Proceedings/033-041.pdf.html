      The vision of fully simulating characters and their environments has the
      potential to offer rich interactions between characters and objects in
      the virtual world. However, this introduces a challenging problem similar
      to controlling robotic figures: computing the necessary torques to
      perform a given task. In this paper, we address the problem of
      transferring hand-crafted kinematic motions to a fully simulated figure,
      by computing open-loop controls necessary to reproduce the target motion.
      One key ingredient to successful control is the mechanical feasibility of
      the target motion. While several methods have been successful at
      replicating human captured motion, there has not yet been a method
      capable of handling the case of artist-authored key-framed movements that
      can violate the laws of physics or go beyond the mechanical limits of the
      character. Due to the curse of dimensionality, sampling-based
      optimization methods typically restrict the search to a narrow band which
      limits exploration of feasible motions&mdash;resulting in a failure to
      reproduce the desired motion when a large deviation is required. In this
      paper, we solve this problem by combining a window-based breakdown of the
      controls on the temporal dimension, together with a global wide search
      strategy that keeps locally sub-optimal samples throughout the
      optimization.<br>
