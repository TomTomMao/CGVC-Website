      Analyses of large 3D particle datasets typically involve many different
      exploration and visualization steps. Interactive exploration techniques
      are essential to reveal and select interesting subsets like clusters or
      other sophisticated structures. State-of-the-art techniques allow for
      context-aware selections that can be refined dynamically. However, these
      techniques require large amounts of memory and have high computational
      complexity which heavily limits their applicability to large datasets. We
      propose a novel, massively parallel particle selection method that is
      easy to implement and has a processing complexity of O(n*k) (where n is
      the number of particles and k the maximum number of neighbors per
      particle) and requires only O(n) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm is
      designed for GPUs and performs a selection step in several milliseconds
      while still being able to achieve high-quality results.<br>
