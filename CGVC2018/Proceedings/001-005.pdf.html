      Breast cancer continues to be the most common type of cancer among women.
      Early detection of breast cancer is key to effective treatment. The
      presence of clusters of fine, granular microcalcifications in
      mammographic images can be a primary sign of breast cancer. The
      malignancy of any cluster of microcalcification cannot be reliably
      determined by radiologists from mammographic images and need to be
      assessed through histology images. In this paper, a novel method of
      mammographic microcalcification classification is described using the
      local topological structure of microcalcifications. Unlike the
      statistical and texture features of microcalcifications, the proposed
      method focuses on the number of microcalcifications in local clusters,
      the distance between them, and the number of clusters. The initial
      evaluation on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)
      database shows promising results with 86% accuracy and findings which are
      in line with clinical perception of benign and malignant morphological
      appearance of microcalcification clusters.<br>
