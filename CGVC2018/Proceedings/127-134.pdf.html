      Cartograms are a popular and useful technique for depicting geo-spatial
      data. Dorling style and rectangular cartograms are very good for
      facilitating comparisons between unit areas. Each unit area is
      represented by the same shape such as a circle or rectangle, and the
      uniformity in shapes facilitates comparative judgment. However, the
      layout of these more abstract shapes may also simultaneously reduce the
      map's legibility and increase error. When we integrate univariate data
      into a cartogram, the recognizability of cartogram may be reduced. There
      is a trade-off between information recognition and geo-information
      accuracy. This is the inspiration behind the work we present. We attempt
      to increase the map's recognizability and reduce error by introducing
      topological features into the cartographic map. Our goal is to include
      topological features such as a river in a Dorling-style or rectangular
      cartogram to make the visual layout more recognizable, increase map
      cognition and reduce geospatial error. We believe that compared to the
      standard Dorling and rectangular style cartogram, adding topological
      features provides familiar geo-spatial cues and flexibility to enhance
      the recognizability of a cartogram.<br>
