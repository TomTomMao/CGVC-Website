      Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to problems such as
      image segmentation, image super-resolution, coloration and image
      inpainting. In this work we propose the use of convolutional neural
      networks (CNN) for image inpainting of large regions in high-resolution
      textures. Due to limited computational resources processing
      high-resolution images with neural networks is still an open problem.
      Existing methods separate inpainting of global structure and the transfer
      of details, which leads to blurry results and loss of global coherence in
      the detail transfer step. Based on advances in texture synthesis using
      CNNs we propose patch-based image inpainting by a CNN that is able to
      optimize for global as well as detail texture statistics. Our method is
      capable of filling large inpainting regions, oftentimes exceeding the
      quality of comparable methods for high-resolution images. For reference
      patch look-up we propose to use the same summary statistics that are used
      in the inpainting process.<br>
