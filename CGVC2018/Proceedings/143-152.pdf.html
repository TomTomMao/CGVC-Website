      Text visualization is a rapidly growing sub-field of information
      visualization and visual analytics. There are many approaches and
      techniques introduced every year to address a wide range of tasks and
      enable researchers from different disciplines to obtain leading-edge
      knowledge from digitized collections. This can be challenging
      particularly when the data is massive. Additionally, the sources of
      digital text have spread substantially in the last decades in various
      forms, such as web pages, blogs, twitter, email, electronic publications,
      and books. In response to the explosion of text visualization research
      literature, the first survey article was published in 2010. Furthermore,
      there are a growing number of surveys that review existing techniques and
      classify them based on text research methodology. In this work, we aim to
      present the first Survey of Surveys (SoS) that review all of the survey
      and state-of-the-art papers on text visualization techniques and provide
      an SoS classification. We study and compare the surveys, and categorize
      them into 5 groups: (1) document-centered, (2) user task analysis, (3)
      cross-disciplinary, (4) multifaceted, and (5) satellite-themed. We
      provide survey recommendations for researchers in the field of text
      visualization. The result is a very unique, valuable starting point and
      overview of the current state-of-the-art in text visualization research
      literature.<br>
