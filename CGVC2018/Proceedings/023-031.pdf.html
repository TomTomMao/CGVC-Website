      In Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) images are compared
      with ground truth images that are known to be of high visual quality.
      These metrics are utilized in order to rank algorithms under test on
      their image quality performance. Throughout the progress of Monte Carlo
      rendering processes we often wish to determine whether images being
      rendered are of sufficient visual quality, without the availability of a
      ground truth image. In such cases FR-IQA metrics are not applicable and
      we instead must utilise No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA)
      measures to make predictions about the perceived quality of unconverged
      images. In this work we propose a deep learning approach to NR-IQA,
      trained specifically on noise from Monte Carlo rendering processes, which
      significantly outperforms existing NR-IQA methods and can produce quality
      predictions consistent with FR-IQA measures that have access to ground
      truth images.<br>
