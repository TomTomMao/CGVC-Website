      Graphic design and visualization are becoming fundamental components of
      education. The use of advanced visual design in pedagogy is growing and
      evolving rapidly. One of their aims is to enhance the educational process
      by facilitating better understanding of the subject with the use of
      graphical representation methods. Research papers in this field offer
      important opportunities to examine previously completed experiments and
      extract useful educational outcomes. This paper analyzes and classifies
      pedagogical visualization research papers to increase understanding in
      this area. To our knowledge, this is the first (work-in-progress) survey
      paper on advanced visualization for education. We categorize related
      research papers into original subject groups that enable researchers to
      compare related literature. Our novel classification enables researchers
      to find both mature and unexplored directions which can inform directions
      for future work. This paper serves as a valuable resource for both
      beginners and experienced researchers who are interested in interactive
      visualization for education.<br>
