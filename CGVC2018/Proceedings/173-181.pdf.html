      This paper presents a multi-disciplinary overview of research evaluating
      virtual reality (VR). The main aim is to review and classify VR research
      based on several metrics: presence and immersion, navigation and
      interaction, knowledge improvement, performance and usability. With the
      continuous development and consumerisation of VR, several application
      domains have studied the impact of VR as an enhanced alternative
      environment for performing tasks. However, VR experiment results often
      cannot be generalised but require specific datasets and tasks suited to
      each domain. This review and classification of VR metrics presents an
      alternative metrics-based view of VR experiments and research.<br>
