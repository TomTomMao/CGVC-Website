<h3>Keynote 1: Rethinking the Design of our Online Spaces</h3>

        <p>
            Despite the ease in Covid-19 restrictions over the past year, people (including myself) are still spending
            more time
            than ever online. The increased usage and reliance during the pandemic has now made the world wide web (WWW)
            an even
            more indispensable part of our lives. And with new innovations like Web 3.0 moving into the mainstream, this
            is not
            going to change anytime soon. On the face of it, however, when we look at the design and visualisation of
            the
            information resources and services on the WWW today, it seems like nothing has moved on. Even though the
            functionality,
            with its endless data and new interactions, has greatly advanced from web 1.0 to now web 3.0. The user
            interface design
            of the web still seems to be in a time warp (i.e. still mainly concerned with the usability issues
            identified in the
            late 1980s). Specifically, the emerging issues of today around online safeguarding and inequality are still
            not fully
            being addressed. In this keynote talk I will briefly discuss the ‘usability’ evolution of the WWW. The focus
            will be on
            the current design of applications on the WWW and how their user experience design (UXD) needs to evolve. I
            will use
            examples from different projects to demonstrate how we can use new visual approaches to design for more
            effective UXD
            and the greater wellbeing of all users.</p>

<p>Dr. Fiona Carroll is a reader with the Cardiff School of Technologies, Cardiff Metropolitan University (CMet), Wales.
    She obtained her PhD in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) from Edinburgh Napier University in 2008. Her research over
    the
    past twenty years has focused on the fast-changing relations between humans and digital technologies. She has been
    particularly proactive in applying aesthetics to digital graphics, visualization and HCI. For example, a recent
    DAPTEC
    project (European Regional Development Fund, 2020- 2022) extends the visualisation aesthetic to ‘physicalisation’ to
    provide users with a more engaging and tangible means to access and understand environmental data. At CMet, she
    co-leads
    the creative computing research centre and is also passionate about exploring new multidisciplinary approaches to
    engage
    more girls in STEM. As an accomplished academic, she has numerous peer reviewed publications and has partaken in
    cutting-edge research projects both at national and international levels.

        <h3>Keynote 2: eXtended Reality (XR) and Healthcare Applications - A Personal Review and Forward-Look</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>eXtended Reality (XR) has recently become the preferred term used to refer to all real-and-virtual combined
                    environments
                    and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables, where the 'X' represents a
                    variable for
                    any current or future spatial computing technologies. However, long before this term was introduced I had
                    been
                    collaborating with many excellent colleagues from across the UK and Europe to achieve what we would now call
                    XR
                    applications in healthcare settings. In the talk I will use examples from these projects to demonstrate the
                    evolution of
                    technologies and the associated cost-performance, and discuss how the healthcare sector is now on the verge
                    of achieving
                    significant benefits for both patients and clinical professionals.
