<h3>Keynote 1: Rethinking the Design of our Online Spaces</h3>

        <p>
            Despite the ease in Covid-19 restrictions over the past year, people (including myself) are still spending
            more time
            than ever online. The increased usage and reliance during the pandemic has now made the world wide web (WWW)
            an even
            more indispensable part of our lives. And with new innovations like Web 3.0 moving into the mainstream, this
            is not
            going to change anytime soon. On the face of it, however, when we look at the design and visualisation of
            the
            information resources and services on the WWW today, it seems like nothing has moved on. Even though the
            functionality,
            with its endless data and new interactions, has greatly advanced from web 1.0 to now web 3.0. The user
            interface design
            of the web still seems to be in a time warp (i.e. still mainly concerned with the usability issues
            identified in the
            late 1980s). Specifically, the emerging issues of today around online safeguarding and inequality are still
            not fully
            being addressed. In this keynote talk I will briefly discuss the ‘usability’ evolution of the WWW. The focus
            will be on
            the current design of applications on the WWW and how their user experience design (UXD) needs to evolve. I
            will use
            examples from different projects to demonstrate how we can use new visual approaches to design for more
            effective UXD
            and the greater wellbeing of all users.</p>

<p>Dr. Fiona Carroll is a reader with the Cardiff School of Technologies, Cardiff Metropolitan University (CMet), Wales.
    She obtained her PhD in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) from Edinburgh Napier University in 2008. Her research over
    the
    past twenty years has focused on the fast-changing relations between humans and digital technologies. She has been
    particularly proactive in applying aesthetics to digital graphics, visualization and HCI. For example, a recent
    DAPTEC
    project (European Regional Development Fund, 2020- 2022) extends the visualisation aesthetic to ‘physicalisation’ to
    provide users with a more engaging and tangible means to access and understand environmental data. At CMet, she
    co-leads
    the creative computing research centre and is also passionate about exploring new multidisciplinary approaches to
    engage
    more girls in STEM. As an accomplished academic, she has numerous peer reviewed publications and has partaken in
    cutting-edge research projects both at national and international levels.

<h3>Keynote 2: The Inner Lives of Visualisations -- Studying How Visualisations of Statistical Concepts are Understood
</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
        <p>Visualisations are used in various context from scientific articles to data journalism for communicating data
            and/or
            algorithmic results, and as evidences to support and contextualise arguments. While the design and the
            visual elements
            in a visualisation determine what a visualisation encodes, a visualisation operates once viewed and
            interpreted by its
            viewers. Designing visualisations requires therefore a better understanding and consideration of such
            perceptual,
            cognitive and interpretive processes. To that end, there is growing interest within the visualisation
            research community
            in empirically studying how visualisations are perceived, and whether design decisions could be informed by
            understandings emerging from these studies. This talk will introduce this relatively young research area,
            and discuss
            our own research involving studies of how statistical concepts such as spatial auto-correlation, correlation
            and more
            complex computational models are understood through visualisations. We will discuss the potential for
            methodological
            innovation, for instance, the use of natural language understanding in gaining deeper understandings of how
            visualisations of statistical constructs are interpreted, as well as opening up a debate around the
            limitations of how
            we currently run such empirical studies.

<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>Cagatay Turkay is an Associate Professor at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of
    Warwick,
    UK and a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, London, UK. His research investigates the interactions between
    data, algorithms and people, and explores the role of interactive visualisation and other interaction mediums such
    as
    natural language at this intersection. He designs techniques and algorithms that are sensitive to their users in
    various
    decision-making scenarios involving primarily high-dimensional and spatio-temporal phenomena, and develops methods
    to
    study how people work interactively with data and computed artefacts.
