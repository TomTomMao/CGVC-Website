  In the sessions within which your paper is to be presented you will participate through a zoom session within which
  you will meet with the sessions chair and other presenters and participate in a Q&A after the presentation of your
  paper.

<p>
  You will deliver your presentation live from your own laptop/PC sharing your screen in Zoom.

  Presenters are expected to join their session 15 minutes before its official start time to meet their session chair,
  set up and test equipment, and receive final instructions.

  possible technical faults during the live presentation. If any details are unclear you can contact the Conference
  organisers for clarification.</p>

<br>
<b>Deadline:</b> Submission of the video must be completed by Tuesday 7th September.
<br>
<b>Content:</b> First, include a title slide at the beginning of the video. You are welcome to talk over it but
ensure
it is visible for long enough for the viewer to read at least the title of the paper. The exact style of presentation is
up to the presenter of the paper. When recording audio please ensure that you use a good quality microphone, in a
suitably quiet environment (computer fans are a notorious problem if recording directly to a computer).
