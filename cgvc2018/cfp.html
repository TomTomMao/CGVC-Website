				<h2>Call for contributions</h2>
				<p>We seek contributions in the form of full papers, short papers, and extended abstracts (posters), short papers. Optional single-blind or double-blind - reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to anonymize their submission or not.

				<p><b>Full papers - </b>a paper of up to 8 pages describing completed research, plus 1 page of references only. Papers are refereed, by members of the EGUK programme committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to give a 20 minute presentation at the conference. Accepted papers will appear in the Eurographics digital library and will serve as full paper publications.</p>

				<p><b>Short papers -</b>The purpose of short papers is to present late-breaking results, work-in -progress, and follow-up extensions or evaluations of existing methods.

					Short papers will be peer-reviewed in a one-stage process by an
					international program committee. They will be electronically archived and are
					fully citable publications. Submissions for the short paper track should be
					at most 4 pages, with an additional page allowed for references. Accepted
					short papers will be presented orally at the conference in (approximately)
					15 minute presentations.
				</p>

				<p> Submissions to the full or short paper tracks that are not accepted for
					publication but are deemed suitable for poster presentation
					by the IPC will be offered an opportunity to present in the poster track.
				</p>

				<p><b>Viewpoint Papers - </b>	For the first time in 2018, CGVC also features a viewpoint paper track
				(also known as position paper) which enables researchers a new possibility
				to publish their ideas.  Viewpoints articles offer detailed technical
				opinions on trends in visual computing or reports on how visual computing
				has contributed to the comprehension of data or phenomena.  We encourage
				discussions of challenges or limitations in today's methods and areas of
				potential new topics of research. We are also interested in application
				discussions that focus on the physical, life or social sciences, engineering,
				or commerce, for example, or related to the process of visual computing in
				general. We encourage an emphasis on lessons learned from practical experience
				for application discussions, particularly where visual computing has been
				employed in a real, working environment.  Viewpoint papers are submitted
				with author names and affiliations.</p>


				<p></p>

				<p><b>Extended Abstracts / Posters</b>
					CGVC 2018 is re-introducing a poster track. The purpose of this track is to
					present late-breaking results, work in progress, and follow-up extensions or
					evaluations of existing methods. In particular, it provides young researchers,
					especially postgraduate students, with valuable opportunities to receive
					feedback from other researchers, and engage in stimulating discussions.
					The poster track will be managed by the co-chair team and the International
			    Program Committee (IPC) for the papers track.
					We solicit poster submissions in the form of a poster and an accompanying
					sketch (i.e., an extended abstract of at most 2 pages, with 1 additional page
					allowed for references only).
				</p>

				<p>Posters will be peer-reviewed in a one-stage process. Accepted posters, size A1 recommended, will be presented at the poster viewing
					session of the conference..
				</p>

				<p>In addition to directly submitted posters, some submissions to the full and short
				paper track will be offered an opportunity to be presented as posters.
				Such submissions will not require an additional review process.
				</p>

				<p>Traditionally, the materials in a poster/sketch can be reused later
				by the original authors for a more extensive publication (e.g., a full
				paper) with more detailed content and mature results. This should not
				be considered as self-plagiarism. However, as posters/sketches are
				citable, researchers are encouraged to acknowledge novel ideas and
				results presented in posters/sketches. A poster may describe a piece
				of work in any aspect of visual computing. For posters,
				we particularly encourage a summary report of collaborative projects,
				work-in-progress, and application case studies.</p>

				<p>Accepted abstracts do not appear in the Eurographics digital library.
				An extended  abstract and industrial project abstract are not be considered
				as a paper publication, instead being similar to a SIGGRAPH one‐page
				sketch or to a conference poster without an associated paper. As such,
				presenting an extended abstract at this conference has no effect on
				your ability to publish a fuller version of the same work in another venue.
