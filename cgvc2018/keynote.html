				<h3>Timos Kipouros</h3>
				<h4>Visual Analytics for the direct support of Value Assessment</h4>

				<p style="text-align:left;">

				<h5>Abstract</h5>
				<p>In modern industries the design and optimisation in complex multidisciplinary design spaces is crucial. It is a process involving the simultaneous consideration of conflicting multiple criteria stemming from different domains and stakeholders. Computational models and simulations are utilised extensively, and multidimensional visualisation, as will be shown, can play a key role exploiting our fantastic pattern recognition ability in discovering relational information in such datasets and sequentially guiding the complex engineering design decisions. This will happen by identifying the connections between different stakeholder expectations and engineering technical properties satisfying a number of physical, geometrical, and any type of constraints. Though the examples are from the aerospace industry, the methodology is widely applicable.
				</p>
				<h5>Short Biography</h5>
				<p>Timos is a Senior Research Associate in the Engineering Design Centre at the University of Cambridge and the lead researcher in the Change Management and Computational Design groups. Timos is also a Lecturer in Computational Engineering Design Optimisation in Cranfield University. His primary research focus is in the areas of multi-physics optimisation methods, change propagation in engineering design, value driven design, interactive computational design, and multidimensional engineering data visualisation and analysis.</p>

				<h3>Prof Richard Johnston</h3>
				<h4>Visualisation in Microscopy – making sense of the invisible world in 3D</h4>
				<p style="text-align:left;">
					<img src="Images/richardjohnston.jpg" alt="Richard Johnston" width="140" align="right">
					<h5>Abstract</h5>
					Interdisciplinarity in science is crucial. The size, complexity, and global nature of the
					challenges researchers are facing down, calls for diverse teams with different
					backgrounds and skills. Graphics and visualization can be the common language
					between cultures and disciplines that both enables and accelerates modern research.
					</br>
					</br>
					Microscopy is also an enabling technology, facilitating huge developments across life
					and materials sciences. And as imaging techniques become more complex - achieving
					higher resolutions, producing greater volumes of data – collaboration with another
					enabling field, computing, is essential. Within our research group we use imaging, and in
					particular X-ray microscopy to reveal internal microstructures in 3D. Engaging
					visualization is key to understanding these hidden worlds, but also to collaboration and
					public engagement.
					</br>
					</br>
					There are a number of major challenges in the capture and processing of imaging data,
					such as reconstruction, identification, segmentation, and visualization, where advanced
					computation is critical. This has the potential to speed up science, but through
					visualization can also enhance communication and understanding between researchers,
					and wider communities. The stories of science are enhanced by visualization. When the
					data and cold hard facts don’t cut it, visual stories can amplify the power of the
					messaging, leading to greater impact on global issues like climate change and disease.
