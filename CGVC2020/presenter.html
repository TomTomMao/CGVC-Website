  Note: the following information is tentative and will be updated as the conference approaches. Please check back for
  updates.

  The conference rooms will be equipped with a projector offering a resolution of 1024x768 (4x3 format) and a Windows 7
  PC that you may use to present. A PDF viewer (Adobe Acrobat Reader) and VLC media player will be preinstalled, as well
  as Microsoft Office 2019. Audio output from your presentation is possible.

  In case you would like to bring your own laptop for the presentation, please note that you can only connect to the
  projector using a VGA port. If an adapter is required for your laptop, please make sure to have it available for your
  presentation.

  Presenters are expected to arrive to their session 15 minutes early to meet their session chair, set up and test
  equipment, and receive final instructions.
