title: CGVC 2020 Registration
---

We’re pleased to announce that the registration for CGVC 2020 is now open.

Given the COVID-19 situation we currently live in, the conference will be held online via video conferencing.

Attendance at the virtual conference will be free, the costs being covered by the Eurographics association and our
sponsors. We need to ask that attendees however complete the registration to ensure capacity can be managed properly on
the online platform.
